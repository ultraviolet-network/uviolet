Ultraviolet revives P2P with client-side validation, enabling a mind-blowing TPS rate, supporting
IoT and AI dApps, and providing trustless multichain gateways & DEX.

This repository hosts command-line executables for connecting and using ultraviolet network. It also
includes a set of libraries which can be used by wallet, exchange and other developers to integrate
Ultraviolet into their products. However, for developers, we recommend to use [Ultraviolet SDK]
(which internally uses crates from this repository, but provides language-specific bindings and
tools simplifying the integration).
